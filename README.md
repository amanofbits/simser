# Simser
**Sim**ple **ser**ialization code generator for GO structs with unexported fields

This is a generator that should help with simple sequential reading/writing of structs to/from binary file.  
`binary.Read` actually does the same thing and, probably, does this well, but it has a drawback - it doesn't work with non-exported fields.  
Also, `binary` stuff is a runtime handler, so it has some overhead, while code, generated by this module tries to be simple and fast.

## Project state

A bit messy, probably unoptimal, but simple and working. It was developed quickly from scratch, to serve a purpose, so the code itself is rather not perfect, but generated code should be at least ok.  
It's the first time I saw go's ast, so it was a lot of try-and-fail behind the scenes. Feel free to file issues.
